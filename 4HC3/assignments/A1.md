## Slack v. Teams

### Slack

**Primary purpose:** team communications

- **Learnability:**
  - Sending a message: behaves pretty standard in terms on interface
  - Uses icons that would be familiar to most IM / Email users:
    - Paper clip for attatchment, Block letter B for Bold, Italic I for italics, smiley face for emoji, and an arrow for send, sillohuete of a person with a plus sign to add people
  - Users are listed in a sidebar, with a green icon indicating online, and greyed out indicating offline
  - The block where the text is sent indicated "Message x" in a greyed out font, which users of text boxes on the internet should be familiar with for text input
  - Other icons are standard for formatting : numbered list, sharing a link, inserting a code block or bulleted list all use icons that are recognizable
  - Hovering the mouse over a message presents a new modal, with some of the previously mentioned icons, as well as an arrow that is frequently used for sharing/forwarding messages, and a start thread icon
  - There is a colour contrast between the message section, and the navigation sidebar, which clearly shows the user they are distinct 
- **Retention:**
  - Due to optimization in learnability, the interface is memorable and relies on tropes common in communication interfaces
- **Performance**
  - In the interface, many common keyboard short cuts exist
    - ctrl+b for bold, ctrl+i for italics, ctrl+f for search, back quotes for code blocks
  - Editting a message requires 2 button presses & navigating 2 modals OR just one button press
- **Error Rates**
  - Users are able to delete messages with three button presses, but the delete button is hidden in a secondary modal
  - Editting a message is doable, and is also hidden in a seperate modal
- **Subjective Satisfaction:**
- **Accessiblity:**
  - Some icons that are less recognizable have a description of them when hovered over
  - 
- **Functionality:**
  - Send a message, bold, italics, custom reactions, threads, robust message search, file attachment, @ing users, group messages, channels, different teams
- **Trustability:**
  - In terms of trust, the design is clean, organized, and without any error in terms of spelling or grammar. The UI looks professional, which is to be expected of a professional level communication software.
