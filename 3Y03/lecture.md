### Introduction to Probability Theory

- Stats is the science of *collecting, analyzing, and inferring* from **data**

- **Probability** = mathematics of random events, intimately related to statistics

- **Experiment** = anything that produces **data**, while a ***random experiment*** is an experiement that can produce *different* outcomes from the same process

- **Sample Space** $:= S$ = the set of all outcomes of a **random experiment**

  - **Discrete** iff *finite* or *countably infinite*
  - **Continuous** iff *infinite*

- **Event** $:= E  \sube S$

  - An *event* E, is a subset of the sample space *S* , where E is a set of outcomes
  - *E = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH} ⊆⊆ {HHH, HHT, …} = S*

- Given some events, new events can be defined: 

  - Given $E$, $E_1$, $E_2$,
