# Lecture 1: 2020-09-10

- If you do the weekly assignments, the midterms and finals will be simple
  - best 6 of 11; 5 will drop
- Kritik is a tool to enable peer-review activies 
  - Open ended work that is marked by peers



## A Crash Course in Probability 

#### Samples and Sample Space

- Suppose we have a data centre that has three serverse (A, B, C)
- At any (randomy ) point in time, we look to see which servers are up and which servers are down ( failed) 
- *Experiment*
